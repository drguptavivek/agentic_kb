# SvelteKit Remote Functions (Experimental)

## Overview

Remote functions provide type-safe client/server calls that always run on the server. They are exported from `.remote.js` or `.remote.ts` files. On the client, the exports are transformed into `fetch` wrappers that call server endpoints generated by SvelteKit. Remote files can live anywhere under `src/` except `src/lib/server`, and can also be provided by third-party libraries. <https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/remote-functions>

This feature is experimental (available since 2.27) and subject to change. You must opt in via `kit.experimental.remoteFunctions`. If you want to use `await` directly in components, also enable `compilerOptions.experimental.async`. <https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/remote-functions>

```js
// svelte.config.js
/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */
const config = {
  kit: {
    experimental: {
      remoteFunctions: true
    }
  },
  compilerOptions: {
    experimental: {
      async: true
    }
  }
};

export default config;
```

## Function Types

### query

Read dynamic data from the server. When called in the browser, the function runs on the server via a `fetch` call. Use `prerender` instead for data that changes only at deploy time. <https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/remote-functions#query>

### query.batch

Like `query`, but batches requests that occur within the same macrotask to reduce N+1 calls. The server callback receives an array of inputs and returns a function that maps each input (plus its index) to an output. <https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/remote-functions#query.batch>

### form

Write data to the server via a form object that can be spread onto a `<form>` element. It supports progressive enhancement (works without JavaScript, and enhances when JS is available). <https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/remote-functions#form>

### command

Write data to the server without a form. Prefer `form` when possible because it degrades gracefully without JavaScript. Commands cannot be called during render. <https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/remote-functions#command>

### prerender

Runs at build time to prerender data that changes at most once per deployment. Prerendered data is cached in the browser via the Cache API and cleared on a new deployment. If a page has `export const prerender = true`, you cannot use `query` functions on that page. <https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/remote-functions#prerender>

## Validation and Errors

Arguments to `query`, `command`, and `prerender` should be validated with a Standard Schema (e.g., Zod or Valibot). If validation fails, SvelteKit returns a generic 400 unless you implement the `handleValidationError` hook to control the error shape. You can opt out of validation by passing `'unchecked'` as the schema. <https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/remote-functions#Handling-validation-errors>

## RequestEvent Differences

Inside remote functions, `getRequestEvent` is available, but some `RequestEvent` properties behave differently:
- You cannot set headers (except writing cookies, and only inside `form` or `command`).
- `route`, `params`, and `url` refer to the page that called the remote function, not the generated endpoint. Do not use these values for authorization decisions. <https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/remote-functions#Using-getRequestEvent>

## Redirects

`redirect(...)` is allowed inside `query`, `form`, and `prerender`. It is not allowed inside `command`; if needed, return `{ redirect: location }` and handle it on the client. <https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/remote-functions#Redirects>
