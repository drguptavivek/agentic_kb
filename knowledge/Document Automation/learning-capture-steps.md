# Learning Capture Steps

## Overview

Steps to follow when you learn something new so it becomes durable, reusable
knowledge in this KB.

## Problem/Context

New knowledge discovered during work is often lost unless it is documented
consistently and linked to related topics.

## Steps

1. Confirm the knowledge is reusable and not already in the KB.
2. Ask the user to confirm adding or updating a KB note.
3. Choose the correct domain folder and create a focused, single-topic file.
4. Write explicit headings that match likely search queries.
5. Prefer steps, checklists, and concrete examples over prose.
6. Add YAML frontmatter with 3-7 focused tags and a created date.
7. Add `References` and `Related` sections with `[[wikilinks]]`.
8. Update `README.md` if required by KB conventions.

## Examples

### Example Headings

- `## Common pitfalls with library X`
- `## Recommended architecture for service Y`
- `## Retry strategy for API rate limits`
