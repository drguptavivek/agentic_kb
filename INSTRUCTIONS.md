# Knowledge Base Instructions

This file is the entry point. Detailed guidance lives in:

- `AGENTS.md` for all agent instructions (also accessible via `CLAUDE.md` symlink for Claude Code integration)
- `KNOWLEDGE_CONVENTIONS.md` for how humans and agents should add and maintain notes
- `GIT_WORKFLOWS.md` for Git and submodule workflows
- `scripts/index_kb.py` and `scripts/search.py` for offline KB search
